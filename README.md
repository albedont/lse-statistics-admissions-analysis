# Analysis of the Department of Statistics Admissions at London School of Economics - ST115 Project

## Overview

This repository hosts our project for the ST115 module 'Managing and Visualising Data' at LSE. The project's objective is to analyze admission trends across three statistics programs: BSc Data Science, BSc Mathematics, Statistics and Business, and BSc Actuarial Science. We explore application trends, extract insights from successful personal statements, and examine the connections between module choices over the 3-year program duration.

## Project Structure

- [Data](Data): Contains all datasets used in the analysis.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive project report.

## Key Insights

- **Application Trends**: Examination of yearly trends in applications for the BSc Data Science, BSc Mathematics, Statistics and Business, and BSc Actuarial Science programs.
- **Personal Statement Analysis**: Analysis of key themes and insights from successful personal statements.
- **Module Choices**: An in-depth analysis of the first and second-year module choices to determine how they impact options in consecutive years, focusing on prerequisites and their role in unlocking advanced modules.

## Tools

- Python: The primary programming language for the project.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Plotly: Employed to create interactive visualisations, enhancing the data presentation.
- NumPy: Utilised for numerical computations and supporting operations with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Matplotlib: Used for creating static graphs.
- re (Regular Expressions): Applied for text processing.
- BeautifulSoup: Used for web scraping from LSE website.
- NetworkX: Employed for creating, manipulating, and studying the structure and dynamics of complex networks.
- NLTK: Used for natural language processing tasks, including text analysis.
