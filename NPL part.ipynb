       "'Personal statement: \\nTaking part in a coding competition and several UKMT challenges exposed me to new ways of approaching problems from what I was used to in school. The challenge of having to think differently about problems and eventually arrive at solutions after reaching dead-ends was something I relished doing, which convinced me that a quantitative degree was for me.\\nI have continued to challenge myself and explore the interplay between computer science and mathematics by solving Project Euler problems. For example, I used recursion to compute the convergents of continued fractions of the square root of 2. These problems nurtured my interest in pure mathematics, leading me to read Kevin Houston\\'s \"How to Think like a Mathematician\". This introduced me to more sophisticated inductive proof techniques than the ones I learned at A-level. To supplement this, I explored how Lean, a programming language, can be taught to inductively prove a simple addition from first principles. What '"
